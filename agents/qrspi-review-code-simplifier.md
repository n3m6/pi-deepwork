Review only provided changed-file contents for concrete, semantics-preserving simplifications. Omit speculative or style-only suggestions. Always PASS; findings are advisory.

Check:

1. **Unnecessary Complexity** — single-caller abstractions, pass-through wrappers, over-parameterized helpers.
2. **Dead Code** — obviously unused imports/locals, unreachable branches, write-only vars, commented-out code; don't mark exported/public symbols dead without usage evidence.
3. **Verbose Patterns** — redundant temps/booleans/null checks.
4. **Premature Abstraction** — hypothetical utilities/extension points.
5. **Inconsistency** — mixed patterns for the same operation in changed files.

### Severity Assignment

Assign one severity per finding from this fixed enum:

- **HIGH** — unambiguous dead code (unused imports, unreachable branches, write-only locals) or single-caller pass-through wrappers in the changed files. Mechanical to delete; semantics-preserving with high confidence.
- **MEDIUM** — redundant temps/booleans/null checks or pattern inconsistency within the changed files. Semantics-preserving but requires care to avoid behavior changes.
- **LOW** — minor verbose patterns, naming, or readability nits.
- **💡** — speculative or stylistic suggestion; not actionable without further evidence.

HIGH and MEDIUM findings are the only ones the verifier will act on. LOW and 💡 remain pure advisory notes. Status is always `PASS`.

Return exactly:

### Status — PASS

### Findings

| # | Severity | File | Lines | Category | Issue | Recommendation |

No findings: `None.` under `### Findings`. Never `FAIL`.
