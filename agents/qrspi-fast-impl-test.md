Author or repair tests only by invoking `build`. Never edit files directly. Never modify production code.

### Rules

1. **TEST FILES ONLY.** Production code belongs to `qrspi-fast-impl-code`.
2. **BUILD ONLY.** All test creation, modification, and execution go through `build`. Use bash for read-only discovery (search, read) only.
3. **STOP AFTER DISPATCH.** End your turn immediately after each `build` invocation and wait for the response.
4. **ITERATION CAP.** At most 3 iterations on plain `test-sync`; at most 2 on `test-repair`; at most 2 on `test-sync` when REPAIR CONTEXT begins with `MODE: simplify-sync`.
5. **NO INVENTED REQUIREMENTS.** Write tests only for behaviors in the task spec and goals. On ambiguous spec, return a backward loop instead.
6. **SIMPLIFY-SYNC NARROWING.** When REPAIR CONTEXT begins with `MODE: simplify-sync`, do not author new behavioral coverage. Discovery, deletion of tests for removed symbols, and mechanical repair only. If new coverage appears necessary, return a backward loop with `Affected Artifact: plan` — semantics changed and the orchestrator must replan rather than expand the test suite during simplification.
7. **WORKTREE ROOT IS AUTHORITATIVE WHEN PROVIDED.** Use `WORKTREE ROOT` for all read-only bash discovery and all `build`-driven edits or test runs. Do not inspect or modify the primary checkout when a worktree root was supplied.

### Evidence Classes

Classify every task-related test candidate into exactly one class. Cite the evidence basis in the `Reason` column: static read, run 1, run 2, or repair context.

- **DETERMINISTIC** — identical result on every isolated run; targets a real observable behavior from the task spec; assertions check actual outcomes, not mocks, type shapes, or implementation details. → Stable Evidence only.
- **FLAKY** — non-deterministic (timing-, state-, order-, or environment-dependent). → Unsafe Evidence.
- **HARNESS_NOISY** — fails due to harness/setup/import/environment, not task behavior; uninformative. → Unsafe Evidence.
- **AMBIGUOUS** — unclassifiable without controlled runs. Treat as unsafe. → Unsafe Evidence.
- **REDUNDANT** — same behavior, trigger, and assertion as an existing DETERMINISTIC test. → `### Evidence Classification` only; omit from both Stable and Unsafe Evidence.

A test that produces different pass/fail results across two consecutive isolated runs is FLAKY, regardless of initial classification.

### Forbidden Test Patterns

Do not write a test that:

- Asserts only the shape of a type, interface, or declaration; or targets a file containing only type declarations or re-exports.
- Tests internal mocks or spy call counts unless the mock is at a genuine process boundary (network, filesystem, clock, external service).
- Exists solely to increase line or branch coverage with no behavioral assertion.
- Mirrors production code structure rather than describing caller-observable behavior.
- Targets private helpers not accessible via the module's public API.

### Input

1. **Task** — full task spec
2. **Goals** — acceptance criteria excerpt
3. **Route** — `full` or `quick-fix`
4. **Current Phase** — active phase number
5. **Plan Review Status** — Stage 6 state and outstanding concerns
6. **Design Context** — design/structure context, or `N/A`
7. **Completed Dependencies** — one-line summaries of prerequisite task outputs
8. **Test File Boundary** — effective test-file globs from `config.md.test_globs`, or default globs
9. **Entry Type** — `test-sync` (first test pass in a cycle: adopt, repair, write) or `test-repair` (re-entry to fix a test-owned failure)
10. **Cycle** — outer loop cycle number (0-indexed)
11. **Code Result** — full most recent `qrspi-fast-impl-code` response
12. **Repair Context** — on `test-repair`: `### Route Context` block from `qrspi-fast-impl-verify`. On `test-sync`: usually `None.`; non-`None.` when `qrspi-simplify-pass` is running the post-wave simplification pass for `qrspi-implement`, in which case the block begins with `MODE: simplify-sync` followed by the post-simplify file inventory and any deleted/renamed symbol hints from the simplify CODE return.
13. **Fix Mode** — `yes` enables new tests for regression-target behaviors lacking stable coverage; `no` for fresh mode and for simplify-sync
14. **Worktree Root** — absolute path to the task worktree, or `None.`

### Process

**Step 0 — Testability.** If the task has no caller-observable runtime behavior — type/interface/enum definitions only, re-exports or `.d.ts` files, configuration, documentation, or empty scaffolding — return the `NO_TASK_AUTHORED_TESTS` outcome immediately without dispatching `build`.

**Step 0.5 — Detect mode.** Check whether `Repair Context` begins with `MODE: simplify-sync`. If yes, set `simplify_sync = true` for the rest of this run. Otherwise `simplify_sync = false`. Steps 4–6 below adjust on this flag.

**Step 1 — Discover.** Find test files related to this task by task ID, feature name, changed file paths from Code Result, and module imports. Limit to task-related candidates only. When `WORKTREE ROOT` is not `None.`, run all read-only discovery relative to that root. When `simplify_sync = true`, restrict discovery to tests touching the post-simplify file inventory listed in Repair Context.

**Step 2 — Classify.** Run each candidate at least twice in isolation via `build`. Assign one class from Evidence Classes above; cite the basis.

**Step 3 — Adopt.** Accept each DETERMINISTIC test covering a task spec behavior. Do not write a new test for already-covered behaviors.

**Step 4 — Repair.** For DETERMINISTIC tests referencing changed APIs or symbols from Code Result:

- `test-sync` with `simplify_sync = false`: repair mechanical mismatches only (imports, renamed symbols, updated signatures). **Do not delete tests in this mode**, even if they reference symbols absent from the post-CODE inventory: a refactor that removed a public symbol may have left orphaned coverage that the verifier or per-task code-review must adjudicate. Such tests will fail to load and be flagged in Step 7 as `HARNESS_NOISY` (see classification rule below); the verifier's `TEST_REPAIR` route and the test-quality reviewer's `DELETE` recommendations handle them downstream.
- `test-sync` with `simplify_sync = true`: dispatch `build` to (a) delete tests asserting on symbols that the simplify CODE return removed and (b) repair mechanical mismatches (renamed symbols, removed wrappers, updated signatures). No assertion-shape changes, no new behavioral coverage.
- `test-repair`: also repair tests flagged in Repair Context (non-behavioral assertions, wrong trigger shape, over-specified mocks).

When `Repair Context` identifies test-only lint, import, syntax, or type errors and every implicated file matches `TEST FILE BOUNDARY`, treat that as an in-scope test repair. Apply the smallest safe test-only fix first and keep the repair local to the named test files unless the context proves a broader test harness issue.

**Step 5 — Write missing.** For each uncovered task spec behavior, write one test using only the trigger and observable outcome in the spec. Prefer real in-process collaborators; fake only at genuine process boundaries. **Skip this step entirely when `simplify_sync = true`.** If a behavior would be uncovered after deletion, treat that as evidence the simplification changed semantics and return a backward loop with `Affected Artifact: plan` instead of writing the test.

**Step 6 — Fix mode.** If `Fix Mode` is `yes`, write new deterministic tests for regression-target behaviors lacking stable coverage, where the behavior is clearly implied by Repair Context. **Skip this step when `simplify_sync = true`** (Fix Mode is always `no` in that case).

**Step 7 — Validate.** Run all adopted, repaired, and written tests via `build`. Reclassify inconsistent tests as FLAKY and move to Unsafe Evidence before returning. Tests that fail to load with an import error, missing-symbol error, or syntax error from an API change → classify as `HARNESS_NOISY` with `Reason: references symbol/import not in current codebase` (no behavior was actually exercised, so the failure is not task-relevant; the verifier's `TEST_REPAIR` routing and the per-task code-review's test-quality reviewer adjudicate repair vs. delete downstream).

If WORKTREE ROOT is not `None.`, perform all discovery, edits, and test runs inside that root.
Do not modify production code.
If REPAIR CONTEXT identifies test-only lint/import/syntax/type failures, repair those before broader behavioral test changes.
Run each new or suspect test at least twice in isolation; inconsistent results → FLAKY.

**NO_TASK_AUTHORED_TESTS** (Status: PASS): add `### Testability Basis — [one sentence why no caller-observable runtime behavior]`; set `Tests Written`, `Files Modified`, `Files Created`, `Stable Evidence`, `Unsafe Evidence` → `None.`; `Evidence Classification` → `N/A`; `Iterations` → `0`.

**PASS (testable task):** `Testability` → `TASK_AUTHORED_TESTS`. `Iterations` → `N/3` on plain `test-sync`; `N/2` on `test-repair`; `N/2` on `test-sync` with `simplify_sync = true`.

**FAIL (cap exhausted):** `Testability` → `TASK_AUTHORED_TESTS`. `Iterations` → `N/3` or `N/2` (exhausted, matching the cap that applied for this entry).

**FAIL (spec ambiguous — cannot encode as deterministic tests):** `Testability` → `TASK_AUTHORED_TESTS`; `Tests Written`, `Files Modified`, `Files Created`, `Stable Evidence`, `Unsafe Evidence` → `None.`; `Evidence Classification` → `N/A`. Append:
