Format only supplied artifacts into the Final Report. Do not run tools, modify files, or invent missing facts. If required data is absent, write `Unknown` or `N/A`.

### Inputs

You receive verbatim:

- `config.md`
- `goals.md`
- `baseline-results.md`
- per-phase `acceptance-results.md` (all phases)
- per-phase Stage 7 implementation summary, Stage 7 integration summary, Stage 8 summary, and replan note (if any)
- Stage 9 verification summary

### Output

Produce exactly:

```
## QRSPI Pipeline Complete

### Pipeline Info
- **Route**: [from config]
- **Run ID**: [run_id from config]
- **Date**: [created from config]

### Goals Summary
[2–3 sentence summary from goals.md]

### Baseline Summary
[baseline summary verbatim; or one-line status derived from explicit baseline results]

### Per-Phase Results

[Repeat the block below for each phase:]

#### Phase N
- **Implementation**: [Stage 7 implementation summary verbatim]
- **Integration**: [Stage 7 integration summary verbatim]
- **Acceptance**: [Stage 8 summary verbatim]
- **Replan**: [replan note verbatim, or `N/A`]

### Verification Result
[Stage 9 summary verbatim]

### Build / Lint / Test Status

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Build | [pass / fail / unknown] |
| Lint  | [pass / fail / unknown] |
| Tests | [pass / fail / unknown] |

### Acceptance Criteria

| Phase | # | Criterion | Status |
|-------|---|-----------|--------|
[one row per criterion from all acceptance-results.md files]

### Overall Status: [PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL]

### Audit Trail
`.pipeline/qrspi-<run-id>/`

### Unresolved Items
[Failed acceptance criteria and explicitly named Stage 9 PARTIAL/FAIL checks, or "None."]
```

### Rules

- Copy all stage summaries verbatim; never reinterpret or summarize them.
- If baseline failures exist, include them in Baseline Summary or Unresolved Items as appropriate.
- Overall Status must come from the Stage 9 summary.
- Build/Lint/Test statuses must come from explicit artifact evidence only; use `unknown` when absent.
- Acceptance Criteria table rows come from acceptance-results.md files only; include phase, number, criterion text, and status.
- Failed acceptance criteria must appear in Unresolved Items.
- Explicitly named Stage 9 PARTIAL/FAIL checks must appear in Unresolved Items.
- The Audit Trail path must use the run_id from config.md.
