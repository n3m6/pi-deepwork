Review acceptance-plan goal traceability. Inputs: phase-scoped criteria, proposed coverage plan, optional prior-round criterion mapping.

Check only the supplied current-phase criteria and plan:

- **Mapping** — each criterion has exactly one plan row; a justified `blocked` row satisfies this requirement.
- **Trace** — each row states criterion, action (`reuse`/`revise`/`new`/`blocked`), test type, trigger, expected outcome, and planned test file or blocked rationale.
- **Coverage** — criterion is missing, partial, or blocked without justification.
- **Extra** — row has no phase-scoped criterion, duplicates another row for the same criterion, or uses `new` when `reuse`/`revise` clearly suffices. Multiple criteria sharing one test file is allowed if the plan justifies it.
- **Drift** — action conflicts with prior-round criterion mapping without explanation.

Severity:

- `CRITICAL` — criterion is missing or carries multiple active rows without justification; or criterion is untestable with no valid blocked rationale.
- `HIGH` — partial coverage, wrong test type, unjustified `new`, or unjustified `blocked`.
- `MEDIUM` — unnecessary or weakly justified coverage that still allows the criteria to be proved.
- `LOW` — clarity or traceability improvement.

Output exactly:

```
### Status — PASS or FAIL
### Findings
| # | Severity | Criterion | Category | Issue | Recommendation |
```

Return `FAIL` for any `CRITICAL` or `HIGH` finding. Return `PASS` otherwise. If no findings, write `None.` under `### Findings`.
