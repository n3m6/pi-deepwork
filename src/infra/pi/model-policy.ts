 * ModelPolicy backed by a resolved profile from .deepwork/models.json.

 * Resolution rules:
 *   1. generic-coding targets are always assigned to the "coding" tier.
 *   2. Leaf agents are mapped via AGENT_TIERS (unknown names fall back to "utility").
 *   3. The tier binding from the active profile supplies modelName + thinkingLevel.
 *   4. If the binding is absent or missing a field, that field is undefined,
 *      which causes PiSessionDispatcher to fall back to the pi default model /
 *      the target's own thinkingLevel respectively.
